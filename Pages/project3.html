                            This project was a group project for a class where we had to use an Agile team to create a website for a fictional organization of our choosing. Our group chose to make an animal sanctuary that we named Pawsome sanctuary. We had the entire semester to tackle this project in the form of 2 week long sprints, with a sprint review at the end of each sprint. The team consisted of 4 members, myself and 3 other classmates.

                            This was my first exposure to Agile as a developement strategy. Not only was this my first time working with such a large group to tackle a project like this, I also joined the group about a week late due to issues with my previous group. Because of this, I had to adapt to what the group I joined already had.

                        <br>
                        <p>
                            I learned a lot about group communication this semester, as well as a lot about programming. Since I was thrown into the group with limited prior experience, I really had to adapt quickly so I could keep up with my team members.
